title: Getting Started with Bite-sized Bugs
---

Some bugs are determined by the maintainer of Pop\! projects to be easy to fix, these bugs are referred to as "Bite-sized bugs" and will show up in the project's issue tracker as such.

The Bite-sized bug badge exists on the right side of the project's issue tracker. New contributors should look for these for an easy bug that they can tackle in an hour or two. Experienced contributors can grab these if they want something they can knock out quickly when they are short on time.

Solving these bugs often contributes to better polish for the overall project. Alone, these bugs may seem small, but when you add them up they vastly improve the quality of the platform. They also offer an opportunity to get involved in the project without dedicating a lot of time.
